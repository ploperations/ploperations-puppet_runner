### Classes

* [`puppet_runner`](#puppet_runner): Deploy puppet-runner and configure puppet runs

## Classes

### <a name="puppet_runner"></a>`puppet_runner`

This module will deploy
[puppet-runner](https://github.com/ploperations/puppet-runner) and schedule
puppet runs that use it. puppet-runner is a wrapper for running the puppet
agent that first checks that the environment an agent is configured to uses
exists. If it does not then the agent is moved back to the `production`
environment prior to running the puppet agent. The scheduling is handled by
the `puppet_run_scheduler` module.
